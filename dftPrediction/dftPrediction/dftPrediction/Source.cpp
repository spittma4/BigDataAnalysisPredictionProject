PSEUDO CODE:
Loop to process an element at a time, iterate until no more new cases{
Array of ADT that will hold the surveyed value and the number of times it has appeared (to get the frequency)

Check if value is in array{
If in array -> increment that node
If NOT in array -> add node with that value and initialize to have a frequency of 1
}

Order array largest to smallest
}

The prediction will be the value with the most frequency, at the front of the array
