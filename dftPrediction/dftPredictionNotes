Insert notes/ideas/methodology for the DFT method here:

----------------

Initial outline of DFT method:

PSEUDO CODE:
	Loop to process an element at a time, iterate until no more new cases{
		Array of ADT that will hold the surveyed value and the number of times it has appeared (to get the frequency)

		Check if value is in array{
			If in array -> increment that node
			If NOT in array -> add node with that value and initialize to have a frequency of 1
		}

		Order array largest to smallest
		}

	The prediction will be the value with the most frequency, at the front of the array
